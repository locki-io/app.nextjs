# **Locki dApp based on Next.js and @multiversx/sdk-dapp**

## The project is work in progress (on the MvX devnet), contributions are welcome
the dApp is opensource and you can install it for yourselfes, app.locki.io provides the AI and storage capabilities for you.

# Introduction
  Brief overview of the Locki dApp. Locki Project is born during the Encode MvX hackathon in October 2023 and scored #4 place on the Ai bounty track. Now with the support of the xPand Itheum program, we are pursuing the quest to bring 3D modelling into DataNft together with an optimised AI companion.
# Features
  Locki dApp allows you to mint, view and interact with 3D dataNfts.
# Installation
  You don't need to, but you can. `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` and setting up environment variables should be enough. If you want to run the dApp follow [app.locki.io](the link) 
# Usage
  Instructions on how to use the dApp, including any configuration required.
# Technologies
  Locki dApp is a Nextjs application linked to a AWS lambda backend.
